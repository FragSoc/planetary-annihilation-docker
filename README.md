---

A [docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for running a dedicated server for the game [Planetary Annihilation: Titans](https://planetaryannihilation.com/).

## Usage

You must have a PANet account which owns planetary annihilation to build the image, since the dedicated server requires ownership of the game to download.
Credentials for the account are passed as build args and are **__not stored in the final image__**.

An example sequence to build then run:

```bash
docker build --build-arg PANET_USERNAME=<panet username> --build-arg PANET_PASSWORD=<panet password> -t pat .
docker run -d -p 20545:20545 pat
```

**Note:** *the UID of the user in the container defaults to `999`, pass `UID` as a build arg to change this*

### Ports

Port `20545` *must* be opened for client connections.

### Volumes

The container uses just one volume, to store replays: `/replays`.

**Note:** *if you use a [bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/), the host path you mount into the container *must* be owned by the UID you passed to the build (default `999`)*
